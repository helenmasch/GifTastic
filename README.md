## Overview
This assignment uses the jQuery AJAX method in order to make requests to server-side APIs. By manipulating the DOM using vanilla JavaScript or jQuery, the DOM API is leveraged. This allows the server-side to use the functionality of another application and use it within its own. The server-side API is where we can make requests for data sotred on a third-party server.
